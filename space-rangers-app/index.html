                <h1><b>Welcome to the Space Rangers!</b></h1>
                <p>Welcome aboard, Captain!  You just became part of the newest addition to Earths Space Fleet:
                    The Space Ranger Corp.  Our mission is to protect Earth and all of our colonies spread out
                    amongst the stars.
                </p>
                <p>Our primary duties will be fighting and destroying rogue fleets of Pirates.  They're known
                    to operate mostly in the Outer Edge, where the most defenseless colony planets tend
                    to be.  But they have been known to make their way far into Earth space.  And the closer they
                    get to Earth, the bigger the raiding parties tend to be.
                </p>
                <p>As our newest captain, your first task will be to pick your assignment.  After that, we will
                    be granting you the exclusive privilege of naming our newest Battle Cruiser.  You will, of course,
                    be piloting this ship for the duration of the assignment.
                </p>
                <p>Godspeed, Captain.  The safety of humanity is entrusted to you.</p>

                <h1>How To Play Space Rangers</h1>
                <p>In Space Rangers, you are in control of a starship, and do battle with enemy pirate ships.
                    The different assignments you can take will scale the difficulty by spawning in more enemies.
                </p>
                <h5>Combat</h5>
                <p>Once you name your ship, you will see the battlefield.  The enemy ships are all grouped
                    together on the right side of the screen, while your ship is represented on the left.  Your
                    ships stats are listed as well.
                </p>
                <p>To fight the pirates, just click on one of the enemy ships.  Once you click, the battle
                    will start.  The player will always attack first.  If your shot lands, you will damage
                    the enemy.  If they take enough damage to be destroyed, then their ship will dissapear,
                    and you get another turn.  If the enemy ship survives the damage, or your shot misses,
                    then they will have the chance to attack you in retaliation.
                </p>
                <h5>Running and Sticking It Out</h5>
                <p>As the player, you might find out that you are dangerously low on health.  You will have two
                    options.  The first one is to repair your shields.  If you click the Repair Hull button, then 
                    your loyal crew will work hard to add 3 points to your hull.  But be warned, you can only repair 
                    three times before you work your crew ragged.
                    <br>
                    Your second option is to flee.  If you click the Flee button, a prompt will appear, giving you 
                    the option to escape the battle.  You will lose the game, but you will live on to fight another 
                    day.
